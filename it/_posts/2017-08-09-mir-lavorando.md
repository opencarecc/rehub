<b>reHub</b> glove experimenting and developing processes are going hand in hand on two fronts:

* Textile
* Technology

<b>reHub</b> Team is at work during <b>opencare - MIR</b> to analyze and redesign the glove, improving the weak aspects of the old prototype:

### Textile
We are defining a new pattern for the glove: a surface of stretch material that covers the top of the hand and holds to it by soft elastic bands on the bottom. Tailoring a glove is not easy stuff, this new model is designed to be easily reproduced with digital fabrication and basic sewing knowledge.

### Technology
Technologic development during <b>opencare MIR</b> was about searching for a micro controller worthy of the new glove, version 4.0, described above.
We selected curieNano micro controller of DFRobot, the evolution of Arduino Curie's board developed on Intel's SoC.

Here a sample of the system we will use to connect the <b>tiny microcontrollers</b>.
