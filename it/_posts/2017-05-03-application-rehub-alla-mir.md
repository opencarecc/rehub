NECESSITA TRADUZIONE

<blockquote><i>#reHub #glove is a tool used to monitor hands movements. Collected data can be applied to a various range of fields.</i></blockquote>

On 3rd of May 2017 we submitted our application to the <b>CALL FOR MAKERS - opencare Maker In Residence.</b>

The <b>opencare Maker in Residence</b> is the first edition of a special residency program organized by [WeMake](wemake.cc), as part of the <b>opencare</b> European project. It provides support, assistance, funding and acceleration to Makers – from all over the world – who are interested in developing / validating / iterating an open source project in the health and care field.

We applied as [reHub](http://www.rehub.pro/). <b>reHub</b> is a tool designed for <b>proprioceptive rehabilitation</b>, to recover movement fluidity after an injury: provided by the physiotherapist, it allows the patient to record and report exercises data such as hand position, finger flexion and fingertips pressure. Recorded data are displayed through a software that reproduces a 3D hand, its movements and detected values.

Through the software a physiotherapist is able to evaluate the therapeutic process and possibly change it. Thanks to reHub exercises can be done in physiotherapist presence or at a distance.

We are still looking for our <b>final user(s)</b>, who will try our product and help us develop different options:

* Sport
* Gaming
* Educational
* Medical  

We want to <b>build a community</b> and start a business strategy.
