Hi everyone! Last week we had the chance to start our residency at WeMake. Our experience will be different from those of [ResQ](https://opencarecc.github.io/ResQ/) and [Breathing Games](https://opencarecc.github.io/breathinggames/).

We are Sara & Mauro, reHub team. We've been makers at WeMake since the makerspace opened and we will not stay overnight or work everyday for 2 weeks in a row, we will have to manage to do everything when we have the chance to meet: Wednesdays and Saturdays from now to august.

Our first approach to the residency was with <b>Chiara</b>, from the <b>opencare MIR</b> team. She welcomed us with the MIR welcome pack and defined our first activity: <b>Agile Planning.</b>
