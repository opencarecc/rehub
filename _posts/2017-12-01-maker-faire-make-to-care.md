On November 29th we have participated in the final round of [Make to Care](http://www.maketocare.it/) contest, since we were selected, together with other 7 projects, among all the projects that applied in the Wellness & Healthcare of the Maker Faire Rome!
Unfortunately we didn't win the prize, but we still think that this experience has been extremely empowering.

Right afterwards, from December 1st to 3rd, we have participated in the <b>[Maker Faire Rome](http://www.makerfairerome.eu/en/)</b> with the project [reHub](http://www.makerfairerome.eu/it/espositori/?ids=2119) in the category Wellness & Healthcare.

reHub has been involved in plenty of events and competitions in these months, and is <b>quickly improving</b>!
More news to come, stay updated!
